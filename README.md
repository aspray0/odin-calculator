# odin-calculator

Being the final of the Fundamental projects, the purpose of building this calculator is to tie together everything I've learned about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In the case of JS, well-executed manipulation of arrays and objects will take top priority, via their various methods and properties. 

Note: We will be avoiding the "eval()" and "new Function('string')" methods.
